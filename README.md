## üß† Executive Summary
PriceFusion predicts optimal product prices using a **multimodal learning framework** that fuses textual, visual, and handcrafted features.  
The model leverages **transformer-based embeddings** for product descriptions and images, integrated via **LightGBM** for efficient and interpretable predictions.  
Our final solution achieved a **validation SMAPE of 37.85%**, demonstrating robustness and balanced performance.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology Overview

### üîç Problem Analysis
We analysed catalog content and product images to capture the key factors influencing pricing.  
EDA revealed strong relationships between descriptive richness, product quantity, and price variability.  
High-quality images correlated with higher price confidence.

**Key Observations**
- Text length and presence of numerical keywords affected pricing patterns.  
- Product quantity showed non-linear relations with price.  
- Image clarity correlated with price confidence.

### üß© Solution Strategy
**Approach Type:** Hybrid Multimodal Model  
**Core Innovation:** Unified representation of text and image embeddings using transformer models to improve semantic understanding and pricing accuracy.
